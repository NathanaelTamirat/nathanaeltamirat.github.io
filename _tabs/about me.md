Hi, I'm Natnael. Welcome to my personal blog website, where I mostly blog
about programming stuff and nerdy things I'm interested in.

I am a Master's degree student at Hubei University of Technology. My current focus involves developing highly efficient machine learning algorithms and models, specializing in large language models (LLMs), across various platforms. This includes optimizing model architectures, implementing algorithms for distributed computing, designing scalable training pipelines, and deploying AI solutions for real-world applications.

Before that, I graduated from from Jingchu University of technology a BSc, in Computer Science (with Honors). As my undergraduate thesis, I designed Text detection and image classification in IoT.

I apply Bellman Equation in the optimization of my life, which is a Markov decision process, but the future discount factor Î³ in the equation might be small and I would often be trapped in local optimum.

The main purposes of this blog website are listed here:

    * Discuss the mathematics and the technical details of machine learning, deep learning, and computer science theories
    * Document the implementation of algorithms for solving real problems   
    * Present my independent research projects
    * Record my personal achievements
